#The aim of the project is to increase the socialization of the students at the school by participating in more activities, 
#as well as to follow each other's activities and to be at the school at the date and time of this activity. 
#In this way, everything will now be carried out in a more planned and programmed manner.

#The application has been created with Flutter & Android Studio on the basis of the dart language.

#You can get help from this site ('https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install') to run the application.
#You can also run it as a new project from there, thanks to the Android Studio platform. 

#Opening the project on Android Studio is very simple and time-saving.

#Before running the application, make sure you follow the steps correctly  
#Don't forget to enter the 'pubspeck.yaml' file in the main directory of the project, 
#click on the 'Pub Get' plugin and install the necessary packages.

#Two types of databases are used in the application. 
#With SQflite, we can not only save the information to the local memory of the phone, 
#but also store the information in a cloud environment with the help of the Cloud Firestore provided by the Firebase platform. 
#Thanks to Firestore, application owners can easily track users' entry and exit from the application, 
#and the events created in the application are also stored on the Cloud Firestore platform. 
#In this way, it is possible to track who is the owner of the application and which events are organized.

#Information about the functions and instructions used in the project is specified as a comment line in the relevant dart files.
